# Bluetooth Speaker Project
Hello, my name is Ronak Patel. This repository holds the files for a bluetooth speaker with a metadata display. For this project, I used an ESP32 to receive the bluetooth audio. Then a PCM5102A converts this data stream into analog audio. A TPA3116 based amplifier board designed by me amplifies the audio signal to suitable levels for 4-8Î© speakers at 2x50W max output. Overall, this project has primarily been an opportunity for me to learn the electrical engineering process through manual coding of the ESP32, design of the amplifier board using KiCAD, and of course much iteration. At the end of this README, I will discuss the current status of the speaker as well as some improvements I would make in the future.
# High Level Design and Considerations
### A2DP sink and metadata callback is controlled via an ESP32-WROOM-32 and the pschatzmann library
- It is crucial to use a microcontroller that supports Bluetooth Classic as A2DP is only compatible with such devices
- The pschatzmann library offers a simple implementation of A2DP protocol allowing for bluetooth playback and metadata callback
### PCM5102A DAC converts I2S data stream into analog audio output
- While the ESP32 has an internal DAC, it is only 8-bit, yielding poor audio quality, so an external DAC will work better
### Metadata and an Audio Visualizer are displayed on a 1.8" TFT display (128px x 160px)
- Metadata such as Song title, Artist, and album title are displayed to the upper half of the display
- Audio signals are tapped at the amplifier and fed back to the ESP32 for FFT bin allocation and visualizer display
- Pushing the display as a sprite is essential to a smooth GUI

# Current Status and Improvements
- Currently, the speaker is fully functional and also has an enclosure; however, I do not have the tools to cut the enclosure. I intend on doing this at my college campus in the future though
- The RK09722MY dual pot seems to be an issue as I did not consider its voltage rating of 9V and it is instead running off 20V. For some reason, rather than volume control, the circuit seems to change the balance between left and right audio. Additionally, both output terminals do not seem to work concurrently at all loads, and I think this is also because of how the RK09722MY is behaving
- For the audio visualizer, I wanted to capture the dynamic range of frequencies; however, bass frequencies are far overweighted in the FFT analysis, so I attempt to address this in the code. However, I think a better job could be done to represent the range.
- Finally, a key factor in limiting the noise in this project is to have good grounding (it is the cause of basically all outside noise). Therefore, if I were to design this speaker again, I would add the ESP32 and PCM5102A to the amplifier PCB for the entire circuit to be contained to one PCB with a solid ground plane
